This repository is dedicated to my "100 Days of Code Challenge" where I solve a LeetCode question every day for 100 consecutive days. Each day, I will solve a different LeetCode problem and upload my solution here as proof of my progress and commitment to this challenge.

## Motivation 🚀

The "100 Days of Code Challenge" is an initiative to improve coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and consistency in coding practice. By solving a LeetCode question every day, I aim to enhance my algorithmic thinking, gain familiarity with different data structures, and improve my problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure 📂

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each day's solution is stored in a separate directory named `Day-X`, where `X` represents the day number.
- Inside each `Day-X` directory, you will find the solution file, usually named `Solution.java`, along with any supporting files or notes.
- The solutions are written in Java, and I strive to provide clean, efficient, and well-commented code.

## Progress 📅

My progress in the "100 Days of Code Challenge" will be updated daily in this section. Feel free to explore the solutions and track my journey.

- 📅 [Day 1: Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles](Day-1/)
- 📅 [Day 2: Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](Day-2/)
- 📅 [Day 3: Simplify Path](Day-3/)
...
- 📅 [Day 100: Yet to do](Day-100/)

## Acknowledgments 🙏

I would like to thank Deputy Director of Placement and Training Cell of my University and I would like to acknowledge the LeetCode platform for providing a vast collection of coding problems to challenge and enhance programming skills. This challenge wouldn't be possible without their platform and resources.
